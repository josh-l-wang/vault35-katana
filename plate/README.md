# Plate files for ortho Vault35

**Disclaimer: I am still in the process of ordering the plates, so I cannot guarantee that these plates will work.  

Multiple configurations are possible depending on your usage of the bottom layout and the middle macro column.  
A universal bottom row is compatible with all bottom row options.  
For normal switches and/or rotary encoder in the macro column, you can use the 1U plate.  
If you'd like to use an OLED, you can use either of the OLED plates.  
The universal plate would be compatible with all of the configurations, except for using 3U stabs in the macro column.  

## Plate layer and acrylic cover for OLED
Since the OLED is designed to sit underneath the plate, it would be recessed below the keycaps.  
To make it look nicer, I made an acrylic cover for the OLED (works for both top and bottom configuration), which works with M2 screws and ~3mm M2 spacers.  
 
Also, with the OLED being narrower than the switch cutout, the universal plate would leave a relatively large window if used with an OLED.  
To get around that, I made a small plate layer to add on top of the universal layer that would provide coverage of the gap.  
This plate layer would go underneath the spacer between the plate and the acrylic cover.  
  
So the final OLED layers for universal OLED plate option would be: M2 screw - plate - OLED plate layer - 3mm M2 spacer - acrylic cover - M2 screw.
